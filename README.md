Following the link above will bring you to my portfolio that I have begun to create for my career as a software engineer.

-----------
Requirements:
-----------

1. My portfolio contains my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
2. The navigation links to corresponding sections on the page
3. My work has project titles with images of the applications (placeholders for now)
4. My first application is larger than the others
5. Each image of the application can be clicked on to deploy that application
6. The page and be resized and the layout will adapt to the viewport

-----------
Process:
-----------
My intentions were to clean up the .html and .css file and make them more readable to next programmer. In the .html file, I labeled a header and footer section so that the all the sections have more of a sequencial order. In the css file I was able to combine a lot of similar attributes. I also added more specificity to certain selectors in order to clarify which elements they will affect. A few selector were out of order, meaning they did not read top to bottom along with the html. I rearranged them to parallel the .html file and I also added comments to help explain them. 

My goal was to meet accessibility standards. The files now contain semantic HTML elements. They follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. All the icon and image elements have accessible alt attributes. The heading attributes fall in sequential order.

-----------
Extra:
-----------
1. I added a favicon next to the title on the browser page/tab.
2. I tried really hard to get an alt tag for the background image and the best solution I found was to add text in the div, that then gets hidden if the image is loaded.

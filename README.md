Following the link above will bring you to my portfolio that I have begun to create for my career as a software engineer.

-----------
Requirements:
-----------

1. My portfolio contains my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
2. The navigation links to corresponding sections on the page
3. My work has project titles with images of my most recent applications
4. My first application is larger than the others
5. Each image of the application can be clicked on to deploy that application
6. The page can be resized and the layout will adapt to the viewport
7. Finally I've kept my portfolio up to date with my current projects

-----------
Process:
-----------
My original intention was to make a bare bones webpage for my portfolio and then update it in the following months. But I enjoyed the process too much and wanted to fill out the whole page as best as I could. I still have plenty more to add, but for now my portfolio gives a good teaser of my software engineering capabailities.

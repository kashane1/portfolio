Following the link above will bring you to a webpage that I was given as a base layer of coding. I was assigned to improve the accessability of the website, increase the functionality, and correct the syntax. The changes I made will optimize the website for search engines.

-----------
Requirements:
-----------

1. Meets accessibility standards
2. Contains semantic HTML elements
3. HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
4. Icon and image elements have accessible alt attributes
5. Heading attributes fall in sequential order
6. Title element is concise and descriptive

-----------
Process:
-----------
My intentions were to clean up the .html and .css file and make them more readable to next programmer. In the .html file, I labeled a header and footer section so that the all the sections have more of a sequencial order. In the css file I was able to combine a lot of similar attributes. I also added more specificity to certain selectors in order to clarify which elements they will affect. A few selector were out of order, meaning they did not read top to bottom along with the html. I rearranged them to parallel the .html file and I also added comments to help explain them. 

My goal was to meet accessibility standards. The files now contain semantic HTML elements. They follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. All the icon and image elements have accessible alt attributes. The heading attributes fall in sequential order.

-----------
Extra:
-----------
1. I added a favicon next to the title on the browser page/tab.
2. I tried really hard to get an alt tag for the background image and the best solution I found was to add text in the div, that then gets hidden if the image is loaded.
